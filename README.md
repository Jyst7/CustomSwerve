# CustomSwerve

**Cad Link** https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ec485cddfbcdcafddcb97bc7/w/cfb60356a67d61b454f14198/e/e863461be36e00b90d8228fd

My goal is to make a custom swerve drivebase with off the shelf and 3d printed parts for around $350
This is a fully custom almost fully 3D printable(select few parts such as shafts and bearings) swerve module that can be combined to create a swerve drivetrain.

I decided to make this after seeing a lot of FRC robots show up in my feed and I saw all of them had swerve drives and I thought that was awsome and I wanted to see with my limited abilities and experience if I could make a working version. This project will also allow me to brush up on my CAD skills and improve by completing this difficult project
