# June 25th: The beginning of my pain and suffering(picking a motor)

Today I planned to start this project properly after a couple of failed attempts to do so, there were many options to narrow down but I decided to go for a bldc motor as they are usually good for things that spin, ie. rc cars, drones and big ones are sometimes uesd for frc. So knowing that I know I also need to budget out for esc's and other electronics ideally some of the parts I will have beforehand to make it easier.

The cost of each motor should be around $20 to get a cheap enough motor that still works. After hours of reasearch and trying and failing ot find motors I finally found something that looked promising of the surpass hobby motors, usually their motors are expensive but the 3650 model seems to have a decent price on aliexpress and with the lowest kv rating I could find of 1650 which only draws 30A so I could get a cheap ESC. I was able to get the price quite low for $15 and $18 respectively, for each module I need two of these, bringing the price per module to $70 rounding for tax. A regular swerve drive has four wheels so I will design it for that but depending on price I might bring it down to three modules. This brings the total motor+esc price for this project to around $210 or $280.

# June 26th: Begining of modeling

Today I am working on the model of each swerve module, given the motors I want to get around 60-80 inches per second and to do that I only need to gear down the motor with a 2:1 ratio so i can do that with two bevel gears one on the wheel and one connecting to it then i will do some shinanigans to get it from the motor to there but otherwise all good. I found a decently large bearing that I will use from some sketchy place called Taobao

this bearing is 80x100x10 if i remember. I hopefully will be able to 3d print most the parts if I cannot get enough accuracy I will go to a .2 nozzle instead of .4.
