# June 25th: The beginning of my pain and suffering(picking a motor)

Today I planned to start this project properly after a couple of failed attempts to do so, there were many options to narrow down but I decided to go for a bldc motor as they are usually good for things that spin, ie. rc cars, drones and big ones are sometimes uesd for frc. So knowing that I know I also need to budget out for esc's and other electronics ideally some of the parts I will have beforehand to make it easier.

The cost of each motor should be around $20 to get a cheap enough motor that still works. After hours of reasearch and trying and failing ot find motors I finally found something that looked promising of the surpass hobby motors, usually their motors are expensive but the 3650 model seems to have a decent price on aliexpress and with the lowest kv rating I could find of 1650 which only draws 30A so I could get a cheap ESC. I was able to get the price quite low for $15 and $18 respectively, for each module I need two of these, bringing the price per module to $70 rounding for tax. A regular swerve drive has four wheels so I will design it for that but depending on price I might bring it down to three modules. This brings the total motor+esc price for this project to around $210 or $280.
